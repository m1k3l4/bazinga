Bazinga is a website where you can test your luck playing at the game "Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock".

This game is the "cheeky" version of the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissor" made famous by Sheldon Cooper, in the sitcom "Big Bang Theory".

# Features

The website consists of the following sections:

* Header
* Game
* Score
* Rules

## Existing Features

### Header

The image used for the header, is the famous logo with the word "Bazinga" that very often Sheldon Cooper uses for his t-shirts.

It mantains the mystery on what the game is, so the audience is more curious and will be led to interact with the website to find out more.
