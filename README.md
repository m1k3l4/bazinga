[Play here if you dare](https://m1k3l4.github.io/bazinga/)

Bazinga is a website where you can test your luck playing at the game "Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock".

This game is the "cheeky" version of the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissor" made famous by Sheldon Cooper, in the sitcom "Big Bang Theory".

# Features

The website consists of the following sections:

* Header
* Game
* Result
* Score
* Rules
* Footer

## Existing Features

### Header

The image used for the header, is the famous logo with the word "Bazinga" that very often Sheldon Cooper uses for his t-shirts.

It mantains the mystery on what the game is, so the audience is more curious and will be led to interact with the website to find out more.

### The Game

In the second section of the website, users can find directly the game itself. This makes the navigation more engaging, because users can test how to play in a straightforward way.

There are two choices : Leonard and Sheldon. Player can Win, draw or being "Bazinged" in case of defeat.

### Result

* Player can select an option clicking on related button. The selected element value will be assigned to the leonard variable.
* A random selection for Sheldon will be generated using math fucntion to pick up a number between 1 and 5, and assign a choice.
* An if else iteration will evaluate players choice and generate the final result.

# Typography and Color scheme

## Fonts

For the Bazing Website I have used two fonts:

### Roboto
### Rubik

## Color scheme

* For the game keys I have used the yellow shade beacuse because it recalls the name in the logo.
* For the result I have used the red shade beacuse because it recalls the name in the logo.
* For score and rules I have used a blue shade to complement the primary colors palette (red,yellow,blue) give a sense of optical continuity.
